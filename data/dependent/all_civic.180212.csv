ALK,238,ALK FUSIONS,"Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib ?a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.",ALK Fusions,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/api/variants/499,499,2,29415640,29446394,NA,NA,GRCh37,Diagnostic,C: Case study,"Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a probe flanking the ALK gene at 2p23 and immunohistochemistry revealed ALK expression, suggesting ALK fusions in three cases of IMT.",Supports,Positive,Somatic Mutation,accepted,evidence,10383129,"<a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10383129' target='_blank'>Griffin et al., 1999, Cancer Res.</a>",Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor,50905,http://www.disease-ontology.org/?id=DOID:0050905,NA,NA,4

This report covered 2 African American patients, the first of which presented high-grade endometrial adenocarcinoma with IHC3+ HER2-positivity as well as positivity by FISH.  Prior treatment involved surgery and chemotherapy.  Treatment with pacitaxel/carboplatin with trastuzumab showed clear clinical improvement assessed by CT scan and drop in CA-125 levels from 988 to 7.9 U/mL.  The second patient had USPC, and was treated with surgery and radiation.  Trastuzumab monotheraby was then administered.  After 7 months of treatment, the patient showed no sign of disease progression and CA-125 had dropped from 144 to 41 U/mL.
